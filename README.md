# Predicting Batter Pitch Mixes (2021-2023 MLB Data)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the pitch mixes that batters faced in 2024, using pitch-by-pitch data from the 2021-2023 MLB regular seasons. Pitch decisions are influenced by various factors, including the types of pitches a batter is likely to receive based on their strengths and weaknesses. This project aims to analyze the set of pitch types that each batter faced, known as the "batter's pitch mix," and predict the proportions of fastballs (FB), breaking balls (BB), and off-speed pitches (OS) that batters encountered in 2024.

## Problem Statement

Teams can gain valuable insights by predicting the pitch mix each batter will face. This information can be useful for game preparation and player evaluation. The goal is to use the provided dataset to predict the pitch mix proportions for each batter across the three pitch types (fastballs, breaking balls, and off-speed pitches) that they will encounter in the 2024 season. 

## Reports

- **Technical Report**: 
  A detailed, 1-2 page report intended for the Director of Analytics. It covers the model-building process, the dataset, and any limitations encountered during the project. This report assumes a technical audience with a deep understanding of data science.
  
- **Coaching Staff Report**: 
  A more in-depth and visual report intended for a less technical audience, such as the coaching staff. This report highlights the key findings from the model, including predicted pitch mixes for a subset of batters. Visualizations and graphs are included to make the predictions actionable for use in game strategy.
